Theoretical Insights: Gained a thorough understanding of web GIS fundamentals and their practical applications in the field of agriculture.

👉 Hands-on Practical Expertise: The use of open-source tools such as PostGIS, GeoServer, and OpenLayers through immersive, hands-on training, empowering me to develop interactive web maps.

👉 Project-based Learning: Engaged in real-world projects that reinforced my ability to apply GIS technologies effectively, resulting in a strong foundation for creating web-based GIS applications.


📊 Project Workflow:

🗺️ Data Collection:
 - Acquired shapefiles from the Survey of India.
 - Obtained SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) data from the NITI Aayog website.

🔗 Data Integration in QGIS:
 - Loaded the shapefile and SDG dataset into QGIS.
 - Integrated data using the join function to combine geographic and SDG data.

🌍 Layer Development:
 - Developed 5 thematic layers corresponding to different SDG goals.
 - Ensured that each layer accurately represents its respective SDG.

🌐 Publishing via GeoServer:
 - Uploaded the thematic layers to GeoServer.
 - Defined and applied appropriate styles for each layer.
 - Previewed the styled layers to ensure accuracy.

💻 Web Application Development:
 - Designed and implemented the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 - Integrated interactive features to display the layers dynamically.

🌟 User Experience Enhancement:
 - Focused on optimizing the application for user-friendliness.
 - Improved navigation to ensure an intuitive user experience.
